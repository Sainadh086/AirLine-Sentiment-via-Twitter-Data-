427,630,1,@united 2nd flight also delayed no pilots! But they boarded is so we can just sit here! #scheduling,18
428,632,1,@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.,17
429,633,1,"@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,",28
430,634,1,@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.,17
431,635,1,@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you,23
432,636,1,"@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine.",22

527,754,1,@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail,28
528,755,1,@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.,25

540,771,1,@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.,15
541,772,1,"@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights.",23
543,774,1,@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture,24
545,776,1,@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.,19

1051,1384,1,@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate,29
1052,1385,1,@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.,20
1053,1386,1,@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.,24
1055,1388,1,"@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??",28

1057,1390,1,"@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?",24

1061,1394,1,"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?",26
1062,1395,1,"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means.",27
1063,1396,1,"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United",24
1064,1397,1,@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead,23
1065,1399,1,@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.,17
1066,1400,1,@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.,23

1072,1406,1,@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?,28
1073,1407,1,"@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded",24

1075,1409,1,"@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip.",14
1076,1410,1,@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx,29
1078,1412,1,"@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info.",26
1079,1413,1,@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!,24

1089,1423,1,@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic,27

1120,1459,1,@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do,26
1121,1460,1,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united,23

1124,1463,1,"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?",15
1125,1464,1,@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay,23
