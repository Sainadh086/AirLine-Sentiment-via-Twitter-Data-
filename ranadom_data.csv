2268,"@AmericanAir I have ""continued contacting"" your phone reps for 7 hours and am still unable to get through. That's absurd and I am livid.",1
2269,@united thank you for fully boarding flight 1689 this morning before noticing we had no pilots. #fail,1
2270,@USAirways worst trip ever!  Wish pilot would've let me off plane at 12pm during 1st delay.  Now 1030pm and still sitting on runway.,1

2293,@united worst airline ever. Thanks for the slew of rude agents and staff making my delayed flights even worse.,1
2294,@AmericanAir is rude a hiring requirement at key west airport shaking my head,1
2295,@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice,1
2296,@JetBlue It was fabulous! Very pleased.,0
